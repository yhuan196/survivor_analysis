<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Survivor(al) Analysis: Impacts of
Demographics on Game Show Contestant Survival</h1>

</div>


<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<div id="motivation" class="section level3">
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>In this report, we utilize survival analysis to explore the
implications of known race, gender, and personality type to game show
survival. In particular, we focus on the American classic TV series
<em>Survivor</em>, which is currently on its 43rd season. In each season
of the show, 16 to 18 contestants are divided into tribes and navigate
challenges within these social alliances in order to promote their own
survival.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Throughout each season, contestants are
progressively eliminated by vote of their peers until there is a sole
survivor. Given that aspects of identity heavily influence how people
are perceived in a social context, we hypothesize that contestant
outcomes may differ on the measures related to retention or screen
time.</p>
</div>
<div id="related-work" class="section level3">
<h3>Related Work</h3>
<p>While survival analysis is a statistical methodology typically used
in health fields to understand the time to an event of interest (such as
death, myocardial infarction, or cancer recurrence)<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, we are able to
utilize the number of days survived on <em>Survivor</em> as our main
outcome of interest. Our inspiration for this project came from a small
scale paper studying the effects of demographics in <em>Masterchef
Junior</em> contestant survival rates.<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> This research looked
at race and gender to determine the outcome of percent of season
survived, with the additional analysis to look at the impact of a female
judge on these survival rates. While the TV series <em>Survivor</em> and
<em>Masterchef Junior</em> differ in their elimination processes, both
our studies explore the intricacies of societal bias and how that plays
into game show success.</p>
</div>
<div id="initial-questions" class="section level3">
<h3>Initial Questions</h3>
<p>Our initial goal was to investigate the extent to which gender, race,
and personality have led to differences in days survived on
<em>Survivor</em>. Based on cultural norms in the U.S., we hypothesized
that contestants who are white, male, or extroverts would have the
longest survival time. In determining a lack of results on these
measures, we decided to integrate geographic comparisons as well for
survival time. More additional questions arose throughout the course of
our research. We determined that another component of entertainment
culture was not only how long the contestants stayed on the show, but
how much individualized screen time they received while there. Thus, we
decided to explore the frequency of confessionals as supplementary
analyses. Finally, in more recent years (in alignment with the Black
Lives Matter movement in the U.S.), <em>Survivor</em> has made the
effort to encourage more diversity within their casts. To this end, we
also wanted to visually see if contestants had representation that
evolved over the 42 seasons. In this paper, we consider all these
aspects as part of a comprehensive investigation of demographics on game
show survival.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="data-sources-cleaning" class="section level1">
<h1>Data Sources &amp; Cleaning</h1>
<p>In order to analyze the show <em>Survivor</em>, we used data sources
from the <code>castaway_details</code> and <code>castaways</code>
datasets<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>, as well as others, from the
<code>survivoR</code> package.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> This fan-made package contains data from
all seasons of <em>Survivor</em>. According to the authors of the
package, “the data was sourced from Wikipedia and the Survivor Wiki.
Other data, such as the tribe colours, was manually recorded and entered
by myself and contributors.” As each dataset contained distinct
information on the contestants for each season, it was necessary to use
joins to combine datasets to produce a final dataset to be analyzed.
This was performed using a full join on the contestants’ full names. We
primarily rely on contestant occurrences as the unit of analysis in our
report, though it should be noted that distinct individuals can appear
in multiple seasons and/or in multiple episodes per season.
Additionally, in order to standardize our results for the survival
analysis and exploratory data analysis, we removed seasons 2, 41, 42,
and 43 as the seasons contained data for a different number of days from
the standard 39 days. As the original data contains information from
several versions around the globe, it was integral to filter and only
analyze data from the U.S. edition. In order to best model our
covariates of interest, we then created a new personality type variable
(extracting whether a person is an introvert or extrovert) and a POC
indicator variable (provided by the package) instead of individual
races. We also used contestants’ home states to code contestants into a
region based on census regions and divisions of the United States.<a
href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>
Furthermore, we determined that missing data was not an issue, as it
occurred in low frequency and was not patterned in nature. The final
dataset used in the analysis contains unique information for each
castaway for each season, including the following key variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>version_season</code>: version and season number</li>
<li><code>full_name</code>: contestant full name</li>
<li><code>age_during_show</code> : age, in years</li>
<li><code>poc</code> : POC indicator, if known. Else, marked as
White.</li>
<li><code>gender</code>: 2 levels: Female, Male.</li>
<li><code>personality_type_binary</code> : Extracted from the
Myer-Briggs personality type of the castaway. 2 levels: Extrovert,
Introvert.</li>
<li><code>days_survived</code>: Number of days survived in the show
until elimination</li>
<li><code>region</code>: region in the U.S. where the contestant is
from. We created this variable based on the <code>state</code> variable
available in the dataset. 4 levels: West, Midwest, Northeast, South.
Indicator variables for each of the 4 regions have also been created for
analyses.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a supplemental analysis, we also used the
<code>confessionals</code> data from the same <code>survivoR</code>
package to visualize the number of confessionals each contestant
received. This data looked at all seasons as it was unrelated to the
survival analysis and consistency in the datasets was not necessary.
Nevertheless, this data also only looked at the U.S. edition of the
show.</p>
</div>
<div id="exploratory-analysis" class="section level1">
<h1>Exploratory Analysis</h1>
<p>We performed exploratory data analysis to visualize the distributions
of our variables of interest, including POC, gender, personality type,
age, and geographic location. In order to best depict the true nature of
our data, we used a combination of tables and plots, depending on which
method we believed to be most effective. In our summary demographic
table, we specifically count contestant occurrences, while noting that
distinct individuals can recur across multiple seasons or episodes
within a season.</p>
<div id="table-1-summary-statistics" class="section level2">
<h2>Table 1: Summary Statistics</h2>
<center>
<p><img src="table_1_new.png" width="400" /></p>
</center>
<p><em>Note: N = 728 refers to the total count of records
(i.e. contestant occurrences) in <code>survivor_data_final</code>;
distinct persons may be listed in multiple records, across seasons
and/or within seasons.</em></p>
<p>Additionally, we used a histogram plot to identify a right-skewed
distribution in ages of contestants.</p>
</div>
<div id="figure-1-distribution-of-age" class="section level2">
<h2>Figure 1: Distribution of Age</h2>
<p><img src="project_report_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p><em>Note: Since contestants can re-appear across seasons at different
ages, we rely on discrete records from <code>survivor_data_final</code>
(i.e. contestant occurrences) as the unit of analysis for this plot in
order to ensure comprehensiveness of age data.</em></p>
<p>We also included tables showing the mean days survived based on these
demographic measures of interest.</p>

<p>Next, to visualize the geographic origins of <em>Survivor</em>
contestants, we created a map to chart the number of contestants coming
from each state. This map indicates that California was the most popular
state of origin for contestants.</p>
</div>
<div id="figure-2-map-of-geographic-origins" class="section level2">
<h2>Figure 2: Map of Geographic Origins</h2>
<p><img src="project_report_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
<em>Notes:</em><br />
<em>i) Seasons 2, 41, 42, and 43 have been removed from the exploratory
analysis due to inconsistent number of days.</em><br />
<em>ii) Since contestants can re-appear across seasons with different
states of residence, we similarly rely on discrete records from
<code>survivor_data_final</code> (i.e. contestant occurrences) as the
unit of analysis for this plot in order to ensure comprehensiveness of
location data.</em></p>
<p>Additionally, we used a line plot to visualize the change in
diversity (looking at both POC status and gender) to view how the
proportion of POC and women has changed over the show’s many
seasons.</p>
</div>
<div id="figure-3-change-in-proportion-of-poc-over-time"
class="section level2">
<h2>Figure 3: Change in Proportion of POC Over Time</h2>
<p><img src="project_report_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p><em>Note: Distinct person counts by POC status.</em></p>
<p>According to the trends of the proportion of POC, the initial seasons
had a very low proportion of POC contestants and the overall data shows
an increasing trend in the proportion of POC. It was interesting to note
that some “early” seasons such as seasons 13 and 14 had very high
proportions of POC (over 0.5).</p>
</div>
<div id="figure-4-change-in-proportion-of-women-over-time"
class="section level2">
<h2>Figure 4: Change in Proportion of Women Over Time</h2>
<p><img src="project_report_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p><em>Note: Distinct person counts by gender.</em></p>
<p>The graph for the proportion of women per season shows a relatively
steady trend around 0.5, indicating a generally even distribution of men
and women in the data. There are some seasons with a proportion less
than 0.5, but a majority of seasons had an exact proportion of 0.5.</p>
<p>In addition to the aforementioned exploratory data analysis, we were
curious to see which contestants were receiving the most confessionals.
As a result, we created a Shiny app that allows users to select which
season they would like to view. Users can then examine the number of
confessionals each contestant received, as well as the total number of
confessionals they received over the season, and the mean number of
confessionals per episode they received while on the show.</p>

<h1>Survival Analysis:</h1>
<div id="methodology" class="section level2">
<h2>Methodology:</h2>
<p>For our statistical analysis, we used survival analysis to understand
the time to elimination for <em>Survivor</em> contestants. In this
method, we suppose that there is a true survival time, T, as well as a
true censoring time, C. The survival time represents the time at which
the event of interest occurs: in this dataset, the time (in days) at
which participant is voted out. The censoring time is the time at which
the participant drop out of the game show or survived until the last day
of the show.</p>
<p>We observed the Survival Time T and Censoring Time C. Suppose there
is a random variable Y</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Y = min(T,C)\]</span> In other words, if
the event occurs before the censoring such that T <span
class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span> C, then we observed the true
survival time T. If censoring occurs before the event such as T <span
class="math inline">\(&gt;\)</span> C, then we observe the censoring
time. The status indicator as,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\delta = \begin{cases}
       1 &amp;  T\leq C \\
       0 &amp; T &gt; C
   \end{cases}\]</span></p>
<p>Thus, <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> = 1 if we observe
the true survival time, and <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span>
= 0 if we observe the censoring.</p>
<p>We use the Cox-propositional hazard model to evaluate the effect of
several factors on survival time in Survivor. It allows us to examine
how specified factors influence the rate of the event that we are
interested in at a particular point in time. This rate is the hazard
rate. Covariates are age, gender, personality type, and region in this
model. The Cox model is expressed by the hazard function denoted by
h(t). Briefly, the hazard function can be interpreted as the risk of
voted out at time t. It can be estimated as follow: <span
class="math display">\[h(t) = h_0(t)\exp(x_1\beta_1 + x_2\beta_2 +
x_3\beta_3 + x_4\beta_4 + x_4\beta_5)\]</span> where,  </p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> represents the survival
time</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(h(t)\)</span> is the hazard function
determined by a set of participants’ covariates <span
class="math inline">\((x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)\)</span>: <span
class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> is gender, <span
class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span> is POC, <span
class="math inline">\(x_3\)</span> is age during the show, <span
class="math inline">\(x_4\)</span> is personality type, and <span
class="math inline">\(x_5\)</span> is region</li>
<li>the coefficients <span class="math inline">\((\beta1, \beta2,
\beta3, \beta4, \beta5)\)</span> measures the impact of covariates</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(h_0(t)\geq 0\)</span> is the baseline
hazard function. It is the hazard function for an individual if all
<span class="math inline">\((x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)\)</span> are equal
to zero.</li>

<h2>Cox Proportional-Hazards Model</h2>
<p>To investigate the number of days survived on <em>Survivor</em>, we
built a Cox Proportional-Hazards Model adjusting for the variables of
age, gender, personality type (introvert vs extrovert) and POC (White vs
POC). The Cox Proportional-Hazards model was chosen since it allows us
to examine multiple factors that could be influencing the rate at which
contestants are eliminated. An assumption of the Cox
Proportional-Hazards model is that each covariate has a multiplicative
effect in the hazards function that is constant over time. After fitting
the Cox model, we tested the assumption and none of the covariates in
our model are in violation.</p>

However, the HR is not statistically significant.<br />
- For POC, the HR value of 0.89 would suggest that the survival time for

However, the HR is not statistically significant.<br />
- For personality type, the HR value of 1.07 would suggest that the

contestants (the reference category). We are 95% confident that the HR
falls between 0.91 - 1.25. However, the HR is not statistically

<h2>Discussion:</h2>
<p>From conducting survival analyses, we did not observe any
statistically significant covariates in the Cox-Proportional-Hazards
model. This stands in contrast with our initial hypotheses that race,
gender, and personality type would impact days survived. The hazard
ratio values for gender (males surviving longer than female
contestants), POC (White contestants surviving longer than POC),
personality type (extrovert surviving longer than introverts) follow our
general expectations. We also included region as a covariate in our
final model without expecting that it would impact survival time. The
indicator for South was nearly statistically significant (at alpha =
0.05), which could warrant further investigation. However, since none of
the hazard ratios are statistically significant based on the current
data, we cannot make any conclusions. Upon conducting analysis on the
Kaplan-Meier curves to investigate each covariate individually, we
discovered a marginally statistically significant (at alpha = 0.05)
curve comparing contestants from the Northeast to those not from the
Northeast. This indicates that it can be estimated that contestants from
the Northeast tend to have overall better survival trajectories on the
show than contestants not from the Northeast.</p>
<p>It is integral to note that these results do not necessarily reflect
societal biases and difficulties individuals face on the show, as there
are several limitations to the data. For example, individuals were only
categorized as “POC” if there were known references to their racial
backgrounds and categorized as “White” otherwise. This could potentially
cause a bias towards the null as some individuals who are actually POC
might have erroneously been categorized. Additionally, each season was
relatively limited in the number of contestants with many seasons having
around 20 contestants. In order to conduct the analysis, we removed some
of the seasons from the show, which means that this analysis does not
necessarily represent the show’s full cast. Finally, there are several
“behind the scenes” factors that could affect how long contestants stay
on the show, such as producer influence, that potentially influence the
narratives on the show. Nevertheless, the show has taken several
necessary steps to promote diversity on the show, such as including a
higher proportion of POC in recent seasons compared to the original
seasons as visualized in the exploratory data analysis. As of 2020, CBS
(the show’s network) announced that reality TV shows must have 50%
non-White casts and increased writing room diversity.<a href="#fn7"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Several years in the
future, it would be interesting to expand this project to analyze
survival times of POC before and after this change was implemented to
see if survival times have improved. Another potential future analysis
could involve determining if the number of confessionals (and length of
screen time on the show) varies by race, gender, and age.</p>
